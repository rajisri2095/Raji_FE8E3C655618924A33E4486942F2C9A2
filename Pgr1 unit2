'''Implement a class called BankAccount that represents a bank account. The class should have private attributes for account number, account holder name, and account balance. Include methods to deposit money, withdraw money, and display the account balance. Ensure that the account balance cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Write a program to create an instance of the BankAccount class and test the deposit and withdrawal functionality.'''

# Example usage:

    # Create an instance of the BankAccount class
    account = BankAccount("1234567890", "John Doe", 1000)

    # Test deposit functionality

    # Test withdrawal functionality
    print(account.withdraw(200))  # Withdrew $200. New balance: $1300
    print(account.withdraw(1600))  # Invalid withdrawal amount or insufficient funds.

    # Display account balance
    print(account.display_balance())  # Account balance for John Doe: $1300
